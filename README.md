# AUTOSAR-COM-Stack

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of Communication (COM) and Controller Area Network Interface (CANIF) modules built in accordance with the AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) standard. The modules are designed to facilitate seamless communication within an automotive system, adhering to the specifications outlined by the AUTOSAR consortium.

## Features
1. **COM Module**:
   - Implementation of the Communication Services (COM) module as per the AUTOSAR standard.
   - Supports inter-ECU communication through standardized interfaces.
   - Provides efficient communication between software components within the ECU.

2. **CANIF Module**:
   - Implementation of the Controller Area Network Interface (CANIF) module according to AUTOSAR specifications.
   - Enables communication with CAN (Controller Area Network) buses in compliance with the AUTOSAR communication stack.
   - Supports message transmission and reception over the CAN bus, including handling of CAN frames and signals.

3. **AUTOSAR Compliance**:
   - Ensures compliance with the AUTOSAR standard for both COM and CANIF modules.
   - Adheres to the AUTOSAR methodology, including the use of standardized interfaces, communication protocols, and software architecture.

4. **Configuration and Integration**:
   - Provides configuration files and documentation to facilitate integration into AUTOSAR-compliant software projects.
   - Allows customization of module behavior through configurable parameters and settings.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive documentation covering module design, API specifications, configuration guidelines, and usage examples.
   - Helps developers understand and effectively utilize the functionalities provided by the COM and CANIF modules.

## Usage
- Developers can integrate the COM and CANIF modules into their AUTOSAR projects by including the provided source files and configuration files.
- Configuration parameters can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of the target application.
- Detailed usage instructions and examples are provided in the documentation to assist developers in utilizing the modules effectively.
